                        <p>I started this company when I noticed that the face of the work environment has changed, business IT systems need to adapt, become more mobile friendly and flexible and that bigger corporations were not well placed to lead this charge. It would be the entrepreneurs and small businesses that would.</p>
                        <p>So I set out to show them what the available tools were and how they could help with this. With the changes in technology that has allowed them to access IT infrastructure and services once reserved for the deep pockets of the large corporations. IT Infrastructure that can grow and keep pace as the businesses grow, adding greater mobility without the unnecessary expensive capital outlay. </p>
                        <p>Today I consult on how best to use services from our cloud services partners at Google.
                            <br> From mobile, web integration and realtime video calling to complete wireless networks for secure 24 hr access to their relevant company information to assist them wherever they are in the world whenever they need it.</p>
                        <p> Just how well is your company's current systems assisting you and your staff communicate and collaborate with each other and the world?
                            <br> I believe that your core business activities should not be disrupted by restrictive, unproductive, expensive or out of date technology, looking for the secure mobility solution whilst keeping costs low regardless of what type of device you are using.</p>
